## Project Overview

### A) Project Description
A small pet project aimed at getting back into coding. The code can be relatively simple (e.g., a basic game with console output). Documentation should be brief but informative.

- Most of my Adult life  I have been working in the service industry. Specifically I've been working behind A Bar, and after all these years i can honestly say the hardest thing for new bartenders (Besides keeping the bar clean) is learning and memorizing the cocktails. With every new Restaurant/Bar or New hire, came a bunch of loose papers with scribbles on it to be shoved here and there in the bar. I want to be able to have all my recipes in one place, to be able to keep my bar clean, and to be able to give all the new hires the recipes without the fear of them loosing the Recipe Book in a accident.

### B) Key Topics Covered
Each team member must apply the following topics taught in the course to the project.

---

## Topics to Cover:

### 1. **Git**
   - Demonstrate effective use of Git for version control, including branches, commits, and merges.
   
### 2. **UML Diagrams**
   Include at least **three** different UML diagrams, artificially enhanced if necessary to fit Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The diagrams must be exported as images for submission.

### 3.**Mobile App Requirements**

- The mobile app **MUST** implement the following features:

   1. **Google OAuth 2.0 for Authentication**:
      - Users **MUST** log in using **Google OAuth 2.0** for secure authentication.
      - The authentication **MUST** follow Google's best practices for OAuth security.
   
   2. **Google Sheets API for Cocktail Data Management (Per User)**:
      - Each user **MUST** have their own individual **Google Sheet** to store and manage cocktail details such as the name, ingredients, and instructions.
      - The app **MUST** implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) synchronized with the user's Google Sheet.
      - The data stored in the Google Sheet **CANNOT** be accessible to other users, ensuring per-account data privacy.

   3. **Cocktail Details Management**:
      - Authenticated users **MUST** be able to add, edit, delete, and view cocktail details.
      - Data **MUST** be securely stored in the Google Sheet and **SHOULD** be updated in real-time when CRUD operations are performed.

   4. **Per-Account Data Segregation**:
      - Each user **SHOULD** have access only to their own cocktail data, ensuring privacy and data integrity.
      - Data **MUST** be private, and one user **CANNOT** access another user's data under any circumstance.

   5. **Mobile App Development Using Flutter**:
      - The app **MUST** be developed using **Flutter** and **MUST** be built to run on Android devices.
      - The use of Flutter widgets and best practices **SHOULD** be implemented for smooth and responsive UI.
